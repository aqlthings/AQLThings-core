  # By default minecraft announces the death message globally, using this option you can either
  # disable the death message completely (messageRadius = 0) or set it to a custom radius around the death site.
  # If the radius is greater than 0, only players in the radius, the dead player, and the staff will be warned
  # about the death.

  #messageRadius: -1

  # When enabled, the module will update the player list name with the custom color, prefix and
